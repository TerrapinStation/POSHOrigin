LONG DESCRIPTION
    Resolvers are various methods POSHOrigin can use to create a PowerShell credential object from data in the configuration file. These credentials
    are then passed to the DSC resource when it is compiled. Using resolvers, sensitive data like usernames / passwords can be stored separately
    from the configuration and pulled in when the configuration file is read.
        
    Currently, POSHOrigin supports the following resolvers:

    PasswordState
        Resolves a credential object using ClickStudio's PasswordState vault.

    ProtectedData
        Resolves a credential object using the ProtectedData PowerShell module.

    PSCredential
        Resolves a credential object using a plain text username and password. USE ONLY FOR TESTING!
        
EXAMPLES    
    vm01.ps1
    ========
    
    resource 'vsphere:vm' 'VM01' @{
        ensure = 'present'
        description = 'Test VM'
        ###
        # Other options omitted for brevity
        ###
        vCenterCredentials = Get-POSHOriginSecret 'passwordstate' @{
            endpoint = 'https://passwordstate.local/api'
            credApiKey = '<your API key>'
            passwordId = 1234
        }
        guestCredentials = Get-POSHOriginSecret 'pscredential' @{
            username = 'administrator'
            password = '<your password>'
        }
    }
