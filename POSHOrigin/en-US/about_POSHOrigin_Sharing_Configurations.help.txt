LONG DESCRIPTION
    Some resource definitions inside your configuration file may have a large number of options associated with them and you may find yourself
    repeating common configuration options across your resources. For this reason, configuration snippets can be created that will be loaded into
    your resource configuration when Get-POSHOriginConfig is executed. These options are stored inside a file with the .psd1 extension. This is best
    used when the option for the resource is expecting a hashtable or an array. You could use this with simple strings or integers but it will be
    less useful. You reference the name of this configuration snippet (minus the .psd1 extension) using the Get-POSHDefault function.
    
EXAMPLES    
    standard_disks.psd1
    ===================
    
    @(
        @{
            name = 'Hard disk 1'
            sizeGB = 50
            type = 'flat'
            format = 'Thick'
            volumeName = 'C'
            volumeLabel = 'NOS'
            blockSize = 4096
        },
        @{
            name = 'Hard disk 2'
            sizeGB = 100
            type = 'flat'
            format = 'Thick'
            volumeName = 'D'
            volumeLabel = 'Data'
            blockSize = 4096
        }
    )

    resource 'POSHOrigin_vSphere:VM' 'VM01' @{
        ensure = 'present'
        description = 'Test VM'

        # Other options omitted for brevity
